To transfer the enrolments and attendance statistics to the updated unit codes, here are the steps I would recommend:\n\n1. For each enrolment with superseded units, update the unit outcome to \"Superseded Subject\" (61) using the Bulk Enrolment Results Wizard [1]. When updating the outcome, record the completed \"Hours Attended\" for each superseded unit up until the transition date [4].\n\n2. Set the Finish Date of each superseded unit to the date when the student will transition to the new superseding unit [1].\n\n3. Add the new superseding units to the existing enrolment by following the process outlined in \"Adding a Unit/Module to an Enrolment\" or \"Adding Unit/Modules to an Occurrence\" [2, 3].\n\n4. Use the \"Change AVETMISS Values Wizard\" to adjust the scheduled Hours of the new superseding units by reducing them by the Hours Attended you recorded for the corresponding superseded units [4].\n\n5. Link the Commitment ID of the new enrolment with the superseding units to the previous enrolment with the superseded units [1].\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively transition the enrolments and attendance data from the superseded CUA units to the updated unit codes while maintaining accurate reporting.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification on this process.\n\nKind regards,\n[Your name]\n\n[1, 4]"}, {"id": 1, "answer": "Hi *******,\n\nThank you for your inquiry regarding transferring enrolments and attendance statistics from superseded CUA unit codes to the updated unit codes.\n\nTo handle superseded units in VETtrak, the recommended process is as follows:\n\n1. Update the existing enrolment(s) with the superseded unit codes, setting the result to \"Superseded Subject\" (61) and recording the finish date when the unit was superseded [1].\n2. Create a new enrolment with the updated/new superseding unit codes [1].\n3. When creating the new enrolment, record the hours attended in the superseded units. These hours will need to be subtracted from the scheduled hours of the new superseding units [4].\n4. Ensure the commitment ID is linked between the superseded and new enrolments [1].\n\nAs for transferring attendance data, VETtrak does not appear to have a direct functionality to transfer this data between enrolments. The attendance data from the superseded enrolments may need to be exported and then manually entered or imported into the new enrolments with the updated unit codes.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification on this process.\n\nKind regards,"}, {"id": 2, "answer": "Hi *****,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding the superseded CUA unit codes in your Certificate IV and Diploma course enrolments.\n\nThe good news is that VETtrak provides a process to transition from superseded units to the new superseding units while retaining the existing attendance and progress data. Here are the key steps I would recommend: [1, 4]\n\n1. Use the Bulk Enrolment Results Wizard to record a \"Superseded Subject\" result against each of the superseded units. This will allow you to enter the \"Hours Attended\" by students before transitioning to the new units.\n\n2.

Preventing the Superseded Units from Reporting  If you are not required to report the units as per the instructions above, you can reset the result of any Superseded Unit to prevent it from Reporting, this is because VETtrak will not include Units in the NAT Files with no Start and Finish date.

If you are attempting to upload AVETMISS files for a different period, such as the entire year, this could cause the error you are encountering.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, I would suggest the following steps:\n\n1. Confirm that you are attempting to upload files for the current collection period only. If you need to upload files for a different period, such as a previous quarter or the entire year, you may need to wait until the appropriate collection period is open in AVS. [2]\n\n2. Ensure that your AVS account is properly configured and authenticated within VETtrak's AVS integration settings. You can follow the steps outlined in the \"Set Up NCVER AVETMISS Validation Service Integration\" article (ID: 1) to double-check your account setup.\n\n3. If you are still encountering issues after verifying the collection period and account setup, please try clearing your AVS token cache within VETtrak by revoking the existing token and re-authenticating, as described in the \"Once successfully authenticated\" section of the article (ID: 3).\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, please provide additional details about the specific error messages you are receiving, and I will further investigate potential solutions.

Each AVS login requires its own token to use the AVS integration functionality [1, 3].\n\n2.

If you continue to receive errors after following the setup process, please provide me with the exact error messages you are receiving, along with the steps you are taking to reproduce the issue.\n\nWith this additional information, I can better investigate the root cause and provide a solution specific to your case.

To troubleshoot this, please try the following steps:\n\n1. Verify that your AVS account details and settings are correctly configured in VETtrak's Global Preferences > Compliance Preferences > AVS tab [1, 3].\n\n2. Check if there are any known issues or changes related to the AVS integration in the specific VETtrak version you updated to. You can refer to the release notes or contact VETtrak Support for more information [5].\n\n3. Ensure that your AVS account is still active and valid for your organization. You may need to reconfirm your access with NCVER if there have been any organizational or account changes [1, 3].\n\nIf the issue persists after trying these steps, it may require further investigation by the VETtrak development team, as it likely involves changes in the new version's integration with the AVS web service.

VETtrak has the capacity to amend or update the VIC Program Enrolment Identifier for a particular enrolment. This Identifier is generated when a unit within the enrolment appears in an AVETMISS File Generation, and is reported to SVTS. Within the Victorian VET Student Statistical Guidelines, the Program Enrolment Identifier is explained as such:  Element description:   The Program Enrolment Identifier links the NAT00120 and NAT00130 files   Exists in NAT files:   Training Activity (NAT00120) Program Completed (NAT00130)   Purpose:  To tie attributes of training in a Subject to attributes of the Program that the student is undertaking.

If any of these values change for an identifier where activity has been successfully paid for, the submission will be rejected. (vr.120111)     The Program Enrolment Identifier should remain unchanged throughout the history of a students reporting - however, in unique circumstances, you may be required to amend or replace your Program Enrolment Identifier. This is done via a unique utility within VETtrak.

I understand the frustration of classes disappearing unexpectedly, as it can impact student attendance and create challenges for employers.

While classes with recorded attendance cannot be removed directly, those without attendance can be deleted through the \"Delete Occurrence Class\" option. [1]\n\n2. The occurrence itself may have been moved to a different date range, causing all classes and enrolled students to be rescheduled for the new dates. [3]\n\n3. Classes could have been bulk-edited, changing details like dates, times, or assigned staff. This could cause classes to seemingly \"disappear\" if their schedule no longer matches the student's view.

This may indicate a technical issue or bug that our development team will need to investigate further.\n\nI will escalate this matter to our product team for an in-depth analysis.

For the students who have the extra units marked as 'Credit Transfer', first remove the 'Credit Transfer' status from those units within their enrolments.\n2.

Most fields contain nonsense, random letters, or similar. A duplicate or multiple duplicates of the registration exists.

The Payment Status of the registration is Pending Payment and has been for over 48 hours, or the client has not responded to follow-up emails.
