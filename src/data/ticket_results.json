        "answer": "Thank you for your ticket regarding the missing booking confirmation email from VETTrak. Based on the information provided, it seems like an issue where VETTrak is not sending the booking confirmation email to you even though the booking is being received and processed successfully.\n\nUnfortunately, I could not find any specific solution or configuration setting in the available references to resolve this issue. [1] This appears to be a limitation or potential bug in the VETTrak system for not sending out the booking confirmation email notifications.\n\nTo address this, I recommend logging a feature request or bug report with the ReadyTech development team so they can investigate and potentially implement a fix or enhancement to ensure that booking confirmation emails are sent out as expected. [1] I will reach out to the relevant team to log this request for further investigation and resolution. Please let me know if you have any other details or requirements regarding this issue."

What does it cost to implement and make use of digital certificates? A. There is no implementation cost involved with digital certificates. You simply need to purchase your required quantity of certificates (minimum 100) and top up as required. Each certificate costs $2 AUD (excl. GST). There are no additional fees. Q. Do the pre-purchased certificates expire? A. Yes, there is a 12-month expiry on purchased certificates. We recommend purchasing the required amount of certificates and then topping up as required, rather than purchasing excess certificates. Q. What does the implementation process involve? A. Once you have purchased your required quantity of digital certificates, our team will be in touch to ensure your integration is set up. As the in the integration work has already been done, there is no additional implementation and onboarding required. Once the team has enabled the feature in your student management system, it\u2019s ready to be put to use! Q. Are the digital certificates generated from the student management system or learning management system? A. The digital certificates offering is integrated with the student management system, meaning that all certificates will need to be generated against parties inside the SMS. Q. Can you re-issue certificates that have previously been issued (either physically or digitally)? A. Yes, you can re-issue digital certificates directly from your student management system. Q.",

In this article, we will go over the process of configuring your email settings. SMTP Information  You will need an SMTP email provider in order to send emails out of your system. Some commonly used options are:   Gmail - Gmail SMTP can be used as an email provider, you will need to follow the instructions in this article on their help centre: Send email with the Gmail SMTP server  Microsoft Outlook - Outlook can be used as an email provider as well, you will need to follow the instructions in this article on their help centre: Enable or disable authenticated client SMTP submission (SMTP AUTH) in Exchange Online Note that SMTP authentication for sending emails is disabled by default and will need to be re-enabled. Alert - Deprecation of Basic Authentication  Microsoft has warned that Exchange Online customers will no longer be able to turn on Basic Authentication starting January 2023. Basic Authentication is a legacy authentication method that involves sending user credentials in plain text to computer systems. It doesn\u2019t support multi-factor authentication (MFA), making it easier for threat actors to steal credentials via sophisticated cyber attacks. Mandrill can be set up as the email provider for your site and doesn't require much set up or maintenance. This will need to be set up by ReadyTech upon request.",

Our understanding is that only Victoria requires AVETMISS reporting of 'activity' as a secondary state to the primary state (eg. NSW) that is providing the funding. VETiS \u2013 VET in Schools  The labels 'VETiS' and 'VET in Schools' have been renamed to 'VETDSS' (VET Delivered to Secondary Students) across the system. We are aware of some variations of the acronym in use (eg. VETDSSS or VETDfSS) and have decided to go with the shorter and more popular version 'VETDSS'. Note: The API parameter for 'vet-in-schools' has not been changed.

This includes workshop, laboratory, simulator and classroom-based\n\ntraining even when the training is delivered using video or internet links in real time. The client\n\nand trainer must interact in real-time and must attend a training delivery location to be classified\n\nas internal.\n\nExternal delivery; e.g. online  (i.e. second position in field) is where the client does not attend a\n\nphysical delivery location but instead  undertakes training at a location of their choosing and using\n\ntraining materials that are provided online or by correspondence. A client learning at home either\n\nby engaging with self-paced materials or interacting with a trainer in real-time would be classified\n\nas external.",

TCSI Reporting - Field of Education Fields  The Field of Education fields on a Program now allow selection of either a 'narrow' (4 digit) or 'detailed' (6 digit) code, as required by TCSI. If a program with a 'detailed' Field of Education code is reported in AVETMISS, it is automatically reported as the corresponding 'narrow' code. NSW Claims Smart and Skilled Reporting \u2013 Transition Enrolments and Credit Transfer scenarios  This change introduces improved logic for NSW Claims Smart and Skilled reporting and enrolments to transitioned qualifications. In transitioned enrolment scenarios, when a unit in the current enrolment has an outcome of Credit Transfer because it was completed in the original enrolment, the unit with the Credit Transfer outcome will not be included in the NAT120 file. The original unit will only appear in the NAT120 with an outcome of 20 (Completed) or 51 (RPL granted).",

Address related changes  Address Format  We have updated Party and Host screens to better support different address types. Users are now able to choose which type of address format to save, \u2018Basic\u2019 or \u2018Detailed\u2019. The \u2018Basic\u2019 address format is the standard used in postage, whereby the unit number, street number and street name are stored and presented as a single field. This is ideal for those providers that want to integrate with third-party CRMs via API. The \u2018Detailed\u2019 address format records each of the elements that form an address as individual fields. This is the required address format for AVETMISS reporting. Address Format Preferences  System administrators can configure which address formats are used for new addresses in the system under Administration > Configuration > Preferences > Preferences/Settings. The following options are available:\n\n'Both \u2013 Detailed default'. Both address formats will be available for selection with the Detailed format being selected by default. 'Both \u2013 Basic default'. Both address formats will be available for selection with the Basic format being selected by default. 'Detailed only'.

In addition to requiring all units to be complete with an end date, this process will now refer to template rules of the template assigned to the program before generating the certificate. This means that other rules like no USI can also be checked before a certificate will be generated.",

In this article, we will go over the process of creating a Staff profile. We recommend setting up your Staff record prior to creating Course Enrolments. This is so that they populate in the drop-down list of available staff when you are enrolling a student into a course and linking them to their respective Course/Unit offers. TABLE OF CONTENTS   Setting Up Your Reference Data  Add a Staff profile to a Party Profile\n\nWarning  Staff Profiles can be set against Party profiles or User profiles.\n\nDuring the set up, the system will prompt you to create a new Staff record from an existing Profile of the system or create a new Party record. Adding a Staff profile against an existing party record will not automatically allow them to log in as User and perform actions against students and courses. This is more for internal record keeping purposes and the system will only recognise them internally by their set Staff type. Adding a Staff profile against an existing User will allow the User of the system to log in as it's set Staff type and perform actions against students and courses. If you would like for the new Staff record to have user access, follow the steps in the article on how to Add a User Profile. Setting Up Your Reference Data  Before creating a Staff record, ensure the following reference data is set up so that they can be available to select during the Staff creation process. Reference Data can be accessed via Administration \u2192 Lookups \u2192 Reference Data. Job Title - Staff can have titles set against them for internal record keeping purposes.\n\nStaff Types - An internal identifier that can be set against Staff record for internal record keeping purposes.\n\nEmployment Basis - Select the Staff employment for record keeping purposes.",
