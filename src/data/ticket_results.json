[1] This appears to be a limitation or potential bug in the VETTrak system for not sending out the booking confirmation email notifications.\n\nTo address this, I recommend logging a feature request or bug report with the ReadyTech development team so they can investigate and potentially implement a fix or enhancement to ensure that booking confirmation emails are sent out as expected.

What does it cost to implement and make use of digital certificates? A. There is no implementation cost involved with digital certificates. You simply need to purchase your required quantity of certificates (minimum 100) and top up as required. Each certificate costs $2 AUD (excl. GST). There are no additional fees. Q. Do the pre-purchased certificates expire? A. Yes, there is a 12-month expiry on purchased certificates. We recommend purchasing the required amount of certificates and then topping up as required, rather than purchasing excess certificates. Q. What does the implementation process involve? A. Once you have purchased your required quantity of digital certificates, our team will be in touch to ensure your integration is set up. As the in the integration work has already been done, there is no additional implementation and onboarding required. Once the team has enabled the feature in your student management system, it\u2019s ready to be put to use! Q. Are the digital certificates generated from the student management system or learning management system? A. The digital certificates offering is integrated with the student management system, meaning that all certificates will need to be generated against parties inside the SMS. Q. Can you re-issue certificates that have previously been issued (either physically or digitally)? A. Yes, you can re-issue digital certificates directly from your student management system.

Course Forms enable each organisation to design its own application or enrolment form and publish online via our portals and their own website. All four ReadySMS Workflows utilise Course Forms. The online forms are created using our easy-to-use user interface and can fully replace paper-based systems. The key features include:    The capture of regulatory data    Mandatory/non mandatory fields    Customisable questions, including:    Multiple choice    Tags/Properties    Dropdown    Short and paragraph questions    Rating questions      File uploads functionality    Partial form saving for later completion Search and selection of single or multiple programs    Secure payments through the integration of a payment gateway    Course Forms also allow enrolments to be either auto-confirmed or sent through to the application centre for additional vetting. When used in conjunction with the student portal, applicants will be able to view all their current applications and the corresponding status. All information captured through Course Forms is automatically uploaded into your student management system.

In this article, we will go over the process of creating a Staff profile. We recommend setting up your Staff record prior to creating Course Enrolments. This is so that they populate in the drop-down list of available staff when you are enrolling a student into a course and linking them to their respective Course/Unit offers. TABLE OF CONTENTS   Setting Up Your Reference Data  Add a Staff profile to a Party Profile\n\nWarning  Staff Profiles can be set against Party profiles or User profiles.\n\nDuring the set up, the system will prompt you to create a new Staff record from an existing Profile of the system or create a new Party record. Adding a Staff profile against an existing party record will not automatically allow them to log in as User and perform actions against students and courses. This is more for internal record keeping purposes and the system will only recognise them internally by their set Staff type. Adding a Staff profile against an existing User will allow the User of the system to log in as it's set Staff type and perform actions against students and courses. If you would like for the new Staff record to have user access, follow the steps in the article on how to Add a User Profile. Setting Up Your Reference Data  Before creating a Staff record, ensure the following reference data is set up so that they can be available to select during the Staff creation process. Reference Data can be accessed via Administration \u2192 Lookups \u2192 Reference Data.
