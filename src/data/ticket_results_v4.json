To allow students to add their employer/company details when enrolling in a course, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add the employer/company as a new record in the system [2][6]. This will create a company profile that can be linked to student enrolments.\n\n2. When creating a new course form, there is an option to include company/employer details [3][5]. You can enable this and the form will have fields for the student to enter their employer information during enrolment.\n\n3. During the enrolment process, the student can search for and select their employer from the list of companies [1]. If the employer is not found, they can enter the details which will create a new company record linked to their enrolment [3].\n\n4. Once the enrolment is completed, the employer/company details will be attached to the student's enrolment record [1][4]. This allows you to track which employers are linked to your students.\n\nI'd recommend reviewing the course form builder options to customize the employer/company fields as needed [3][5]. Let me know if you need any other assistance with setting this up."}, {"id": 1, "answer": "Hi,\n\nThank you for your inquiry regarding allowing students to add their employer details during the course enrollment process.\n\nCurrently, the system does not have a built-in feature that allows students to directly add or select their employer/company information when enrolling in a course. [1] However, there are a few potential workarounds we can explore:\n\n1. You can create a custom form field in the Course Application Form to capture the employer/company details from the student. [4] This information can then be used by your staff to manually link the student's enrollment to the appropriate company record in the system.\n\n2. Alternatively, you could consider having your staff add the employer/company details to the student's enrollment record after they have submitted the application. [7] This would require an additional step from your staff, but would allow you to link the enrollment to the correct company.\n\n3. Another option is to explore the possibility of integrating a custom workflow or process that would allow students to search for and select their employer/company during the enrollment process. [8] This would likely require some development work, but could provide a more streamlined experience for the students.\n\nIf none of these options are suitable, I would recommend submitting a feature request to our product team for consideration in future releases. [2] They are always looking for ways to improve the system and enhance the user experience.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or have additional questions.\n\nKind Regards,\n[Your Name]"}, {"id": 2, "answer": "Hi there,\n\nThank you for your inquiry about allowing students to enter their employer details during course enrolment. Here are a few options to achieve this:\n\n1. During the enrolment process, there is an \"Employer Details\" section where you can search for and attach the student's employer company [1]. This will link the employer to the student's enrolment record.\n\n2. In the Employer Portal, employers can view and manage enrolments for their employees under the \"Enrolments\" section [4][2]. So if the employer company is already set up, the student can select it during enrolment.\n\n3. You can also include employer/company fields in your course application/enrolment forms that students fill out [1]. The responses can then be used to either create a new company record or link an existing one to the student's enrolment.\n\nI'd recommend reviewing your current enrolment workflow and forms to determine the best approach.

What's going on?\n\nCheck that any email templates attached to the application process are correct. e.g. if you have copied merge fields from another template somewhere in the system, the specific merge tags may not be appropriate for the template where you're pasting the email. Double check that all the merge fields are available in the merge fields list to the right hand side of the window.\n\nI'm setting up an accredited workflow. I can see student applications sitting in my course, but they're not moving into the 'enrolled' field even though I've checked 'auto enrol.' What's going on?\n\nMake sure you've definitely:\n\nticked auto enrol on the course application\n\nchecked you have a funding source for your course. Enrolment won't go through without this\n\nTry manually adding an application (Courses > Applications > new application) and then processing the enrolment manually through the enrolment wizard.

I can understand how frustrating and confusing this would be, especially when trying to enroll students before the course start date [2].\n\nBased on the details provided, it seems there may be a configuration issue causing the incorrect start date to display specifically on the application form, even though it is showing correctly in other areas like the event series and course record [2][3].\n\nA few suggestions to try troubleshooting this:\n\n1. Double check the course form settings to ensure the correct course and start date are selected [2]. Sometimes linking the wrong course or having stale caching can cause incorrect data to display.\n\n2. Try clearing your browser cache and cookies, then reloading the application form page. Caching issues can sometimes cause stale data to display [3].\n\n3. As a temporary workaround, you could consider adding clarifying text on the form to indicate the correct start date until we can resolve the display issue [1].\n\nI've logged a bug report with our development team to investigate why the start date is not pulling through correctly to the application form. They will work on getting this fixed as soon as possible given the urgency [2][3][1].\n\nIn the meantime, please let me know if the issue persists after trying the troubleshooting steps above. I'm happy to further investigate or escalate this to get it resolved quickly so it doesn't continue impacting your enrollments [2][3][1].\n\nThank you for your patience, and please let me know if you need any other assistance.\n\nKind regards,"}, {"id": 1, "answer": "Hi there,\n\nThank you for bringing this issue to our attention. I understand the urgency, as an incorrect course start date on the application form can cause confusion and hinder the enrollment process.\n\nThe issue you're experiencing with the course start date displaying incorrectly on the application form seems to be a known bug that was recently fixed [3]. We have updated the behavior of the course start date on application forms to ensure it pulls the correct date from the course and event series settings [1].\n\nTo resolve this, I would suggest clearing your browser cache and trying again. If the issue persists after that, please let me know the specific course ID, and I can look into it further to ensure the fix is applied properly.\n\nIn the meantime, as a workaround, you can temporarily update the course start date field on the application form settings to match the correct date from the course and event series. This should allow applicants to see the right start date until we can confirm the fix is working as expected [1].\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or concerns. Ensuring accurate course information on application forms is crucial, and I want to make sure this gets resolved promptly.\n\nThank you,"}, {"id": 2, "answer": "Hi there,\n\nThank you for bringing this issue to our attention. I understand the urgency given the strict enrollment deadline for this course.\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems there is an issue with the course start date not displaying correctly on the public application form link, despite being correct in other areas of the system [4]. This can indeed cause confusion for potential students trying to enroll.\n\nTo troubleshoot this, I would first suggest clearing your browser cache and trying again, as sometimes cached data can cause display issues on webforms. If that doesn't resolve it, please let me know and I can look into it further [1].\n\nIn the meantime, as a workaround, you could consider adding a note on the application form clarifying the correct course start date. Or you may want to temporarily unpublish the form and direct students to enroll through your staff instead until we can get this issue resolved.\n\nI've flagged this with our development team as a high priority issue to investigate and fix as soon as possible. Ensuring accurate course information on application forms is critical, especially during peak enrollment periods. Please keep me updated if you notice any other abnormalities, and I'll do the same regarding progress on a fix.\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nKind Regards,"}], "related_knowledge": [{"rank": "1", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "26967 - We have fixed an issue on the Smart Fees Invoicing page where fees could be duplicated by clicking the 'Accept All' and 'Add' buttons at the same time. 24299 - We have removed the 'Number of days before first instalment' field from the DebitSuccess integration config page.

Review the conditions tab and ensure there are no conflicting rules applied.\n\n2. Try creating a brand new course application form from scratch instead of editing the existing one [2][3].

Check the form settings and conditions to ensure that there are no conflicting rules or conditions related to the first name field [1].\n2.

If you would like to set up a more automated process, see the ReadySMS Automated Workflows article. Manual workflows are designed to be used without the course forms feature of the SMS.\n\nReadySMS Manual Workflows\n\nThree options exist for the manual applications and enrolments process. The first can be used for simple individual student enrolment and the second for simple bulk enrolment. The third workflow uses a manual, paper application process, but then leverages some simple automations within the system to manage the application (e.g. automates emails to students).\n\nOverview of the Workflows\n\n1. Manual Individual Enrolment This process involves student's applying for a course using a paper application form. Upon receipt of this form, a student party record is created manually. The student can then be processed through the enrolment wizard and a payment can be taken. For this process, any communication with the student must be performed manually and admin notifications are not available.\n\n2. Manual Bulk Enrolment The manual bulk enrolment process uses paper applications for initial student applications. Upon receipt of this form, a student party record is created manually. After the desired number of applications are completed and party records made, a bulk enrolment step can be performed to process students into courses. Payments can be taken following the enrolment step.", "metadata": {"title": "JR-Plus_51000334800.txt", "link": "https://help-education.readytech.io/support/solutions/articles/51000334800", "category": "JR-Plus"}}, {"rank": "9", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "People- This shows which User is currently Assigned to the Application and whether there is an associated Employer or Agent.

Manual Kanban Enrolment  The manual Kanban enrolment leverages some of the automations within the system, without the use of a Course Form. Here, students apply using a manual application and party records are manual added to the system. The manual course application feature (Courses > Applications >new application) is then used to add applications into the Kanban for processing. The benefit of this is that it allows for automated emails to be sent to students based on their position in the application process. This process is recommended when you have to take manual applications for large numbers of students. All students can be added manually as they're submitted, then applications can be processed at a later date. The automated communications can then be leveraged for mass communications of large numbers of students.

We currently use JR for our applications. This is excellent for vetting students and getting all AVETMISS data required. However, we have an external enrolment site where we gather selection and payment, and then come back into JR for manual enrolment. I was hoping to move our subject enrolment form  similar to a course form  into JR to utilise the auto enrolment feature and link payment  for upfront, or payment plan invoicing . I believe this will save us time. My proposed workflow is this   *. Student submits Application  *. Application is approved by admin. *. Once approved, an email will be auto generated send a student an enrolment form  *. Student then fills out enrolment form, pays for subjects  *. Student is auto enrolled into the linked units.

Institutions can also use this tool to collect information from prospects, feedback from alumni or even allow students to request services. Add a Course Form  To add a Course Form, follow these steps:   Go to Administration \u2192 Forms \u2192 Course Forms. Click, + New. Complete the New Form window. Name - Provide the Course Form with a unique name for easy future reference. Branding - There is the option to apply a custom brand per Course Form. This is a great way to white-label the Course Application Forms or even apply joint branding. This is customisable per Course Form. Location - This field references the institution's pre-existing Locations. To add or edit to these locations go to: Administration >> Lookups >> Locations/Facilities. If this Course Form is linked to multiple courses with different locations, you can leave this option blank. Enabled - If checked, this Course Form will be enabled/active. This means that at any time when you go to assign a Form, you can select this Form as an option.", "metadata": {"title": "JR-Plus_51000289617.txt", "link": "https://help-education.readytech.io/support/solutions/articles/51000289617", "category": "JR-Plus"}}, {"rank": "10", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "Resource Links\n\nFAQ What are Course Forms? Course Forms enable each organisation to design its own application or enrolment form and publish online via our portals and their own website. All four ReadySMS Workflows utilise Course Forms. The online forms are created using our easy-to-use user interface and can fully replace paper-based systems. The key features include:    The capture of regulatory data    Mandatory/non mandatory fields    Customisable questions, including:    Multiple choice    Tags/Properties    Dropdown    Short and paragraph questions    Rating questions      File uploads functionality    Partial form saving for later completion Search and selection of single or multiple programs    Secure payments through the integration of a payment gateway    Course Forms also allow enrolments to be either auto-confirmed or sent through to the application centre for additional vetting. When used in conjunction with the student portal, applicants will be able to view all their current applications and the corresponding status. All information captured through Course Forms is automatically uploaded into your student management system.

However, there appears to be an issue with VETtrak not sending its own booking confirmation email as expected.\n\nAs I could not find any documentation specifically addressing this scenario, I would suggest the following steps:\n\n1. Check the VETtrak settings to ensure email notifications for new bookings/enrolments are enabled and configured correctly. The settings should allow VETtrak to send a confirmation email to the designated recipient(s) when a new booking comes in.\n\n2. Review the email logs or history in VETtrak to see if any booking confirmation emails were attempted to be sent but failed for any reason. This may provide clues on why the emails are not being received.\n\n3. Test by manually creating a new enrolment or booking in VETtrak and see if the confirmation email is sent successfully. This can help isolate if the issue is specific to the online booking integration or a broader configuration problem in VETtrak.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, it would be best to log a support case with the ReadyTech team for further investigation. They may need to review your specific VETtrak setup and configurations to determine why the booking confirmations are not being sent as expected from their system.

Set up rules or filters in your email client to hold or delay delivery of emails from VETtrak for a set period of time [2]. This would give you a window to cancel emails before they are sent to recipients.\n\n2. Explore third-party email delay software or services that could integrate with VETtrak's email functionality to add a delay buffer.\n\n3. Implement a manual review process for emails before they are sent from VETtrak, though this may not be practical depending on your email volume.\n\nI understand the need to have more control over when emails are delivered. While VETtrak does not have this capability built-in, I'm happy to discuss any of the workaround options further or explore other potential solutions with you. Please let me know if you would like me to investigate this further or if you have any other questions."}, {"id": 2, "answer": "Hi there,\n\nThank you for your request regarding delaying the sending of emails from VETtrak. In the Email Preferences [1], there is a setting called \"Wait time between emails\" that controls the delay between successive emails being sent out from VETtrak's built-in email client.\n\nThis wait time setting is intended to prevent overloading mail servers when sending out bulk emails. However, it can also provide a short window to potentially cancel emails before they are sent [1]. The Notifications feature also has an option to enable notifications to be sent via email in addition to appearing in the relevant portal [3]. So adjusting the wait time between emails could give you a bit more time to cancel notifications before they get emailed out.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no built-in way to hold emails in a queue for an extended period of time before sending in VETtrak. Emails get processed and sent out relatively quickly based on the wait time setting [1]. VETtrak also does not have the ability to recall or cancel emails after they have already been sent out from the system.\n\nIf you need a longer delay window to review and approve emails before sending, one potential solution could be to set up a third-party email service or mail server that can queue up emails first. Then you could configure VETtrak to send emails through that external mail server [1]. That would allow you to review the queued emails on the third-party system before releasing them to send out. However, this would require additional setup and configuration.\n\nI'll bring up your request for a longer email queue delay window to our product team for consideration in future VETtrak updates.

There needs to be an additional flag or identifier to indicate that the student has come through an OSO.\n\nUnfortunately, I could not find any existing functionality or data element in our system that allows for specifically flagging OSO students for ACE DESK reporting while retaining their existing disadvantage criteria and funding source. This appears to be a new requirement that is not currently supported.\n\nI will raise this with our product team as a potential enhancement request. They will evaluate the requirement and prioritize it accordingly in our development roadmap. In the meantime, I would suggest exploring alternative methods to track or identify these OSO students, such as using custom fields or tags within the system [5].\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention.

This form of import can serve as a jumping-off point for a much larger migration project, or can stand alone as a means to quickly and efficiently move data from your current student management system over to VETtrak. It's important to be aware of the limitations of such an import, and the purpose of this article is to inform what data is present in a set of NAT files, how much can be imported, as well as advise what data is not present. This article is broken up into the individual files one would find in an AVETMISS generation, and includes a description of the contents of the file as well as what we can retrieve from it. There are variations between files reported to NCVER and those that are reported to state bodies and where relevant, the additional state data is specified.

The Specialisation Name for an award can be reported in the NAT130 file in VIC from 2022. See below for more information. Commenced while at school. A new \"Commenced while at school\" field has been added to the AVETMISS page in VIC. This will be reported in the NAT130 file in VIC from 2022. This is the client's \"at school\" status at the time the enrolment commenced, and should not be changed for the duration of the enrolment even if the client's \"at school\" status changes. During the database upgrade, all existing enrolments will have this set from the client's \"at school\" status. When creating a new enrolment, this field will be set from the client's current \"at school\" status. Client tuition fee. The client tuition fee field in the NAT120 in VIC will now be reported as 0 if the outcome is 54 or 85 (this is in addition to the existing logic that also reports a 0 client tuition fee if the outcome 53 or 60, or if there's a fee waiver). ERA claim exclusion. The \"Exclude from reapportioning\" (ERA) claim exclusion code is no longer valid from 2022.

Once the new location is created, you can start using it for any new enrolments or course offerings at that address. However, for any existing enrolments already reported against the old location code, you will need to keep the original location details to avoid data integrity issues [2].\n\nTo create the new location with the updated ************************* address:\n\n1.

The Profile ID, also known as the Party Identifier, is a unique alphanumeric value assigned to each party profile in the system [1]. While you cannot directly edit or change this ID, there are a couple of options:\n\n1. If you need to change the ID for an existing profile, you can create a new party profile with the desired ID and transfer over all the associated data from the old profile [1]. This will essentially replace the old profile with a new one having the updated ID.\n\n2. For new profiles being created, you can manually enter the desired ID during the creation process before the system auto-generates one [1][2]. This allows you to set the initial Party Identifier as per your requirements.\n\nPlease note that changing or setting Party IDs requires appropriate user permissions.

There are a few scenarios when merging two party profiles would be beneficial:   There are multiple party profiles for one student, which can occur automatically when using course forms. Two party profiles were created for one student by accident. One person has enrolments on multiple party profiles. Ensuring that your system is organised will make it easier to manage your student data. Having duplicate party profiles for the same student can lead to unnecessary complications when using the system. Merging Two Party Profiles Together  Go to the party profile that you would like to keep (the primary party profile) and click on Admin \u2192 Merge Parties.

Let me provide some information on the points you raised:\n\nAdding Custom Fields to Party Profile:\nJR Plus allows adding custom fields to the Party Profile through the Party Custom Content section [5]. These fields can be used to capture additional details like cohort/demographic information (CALD, disability, youth, etc.) that you mentioned. To add new custom fields, you would need to submit a request through the Report Builder process [5]. Our team can then work on implementing the requested fields.\n\nCreating In-App Custom Reports:\nJR Plus provides the ability to create custom reports through the Report Builder [2]. However, these custom reports are designed to be exported or printed, similar to the standard out-of-the-box reports. Currently, there is no functionality to create reports that are viewable only within the application and cannot be exported [2]. This capability would require further product enhancements.\n\nRestricting Data Export:\nJR Plus has role-based access controls that allow restricting certain users from accessing specific areas or functions of the system. However, there is no straightforward way to completely prevent data export for a particular user role while still allowing access to reports [2]. This would likely require significant customization efforts.\n\nI understand your goal is to prevent sensitive data from being extracted outside the system. While JR Plus does not have a built-in feature for this currently, I would recommend exploring alternative approaches like:\n\n1. Implementing strict data governance policies and training for users with access to reports.\n2. Considering data masking or redaction techniques for sensitive fields in reports.\n3. Exploring third-party reporting/analytics tools with better control over data export.\n\nOur team can further discuss potential solutions if this is a critical requirement for your organization.

The \"Authentication unsuccessful\" error you are receiving is likely due to the recent change in security settings for your Microsoft email account with multi-factor authentication enabled.\n\nMicrosoft and Google are deprecating basic SMTP authentication for Office365 and Gmail accounts. VETtrak currently only supports SMTP authentication, so a workaround is needed to bypass the multi-factor authentication requirement [1].\n\nFor Office365 accounts, the recommended solution is to set up an SMTP relay through your IT team or mail server admin [1]. This will allow VETtrak to send emails without being blocked by multi-factor authentication. The steps to configure the SMTP relay are outlined in this Microsoft article: [Link to Microsoft article].\n\nOnce the SMTP relay is set up, you can update the VETtrak email preferences with the relay details, such as the SMTP server hostname, port number, and if authentication is required [1].\n\nIf you continue to face issues after setting up the SMTP relay, please check the error code details in the \"Email Troubleshooting\" section of our help documentation [2][3].

This will allow VETtrak to send emails without requiring multi-factor authentication. The exact configuration details need to be provided by your IT team.\n\n2. For Gmail accounts, you can generate an application-specific password and use that as the email login password in VETtrak's email preferences instead of your actual Gmail password [4].\n\nIf you continue facing the \"Authentication unsuccessful\" error (code 535) [3] after trying the above steps, please check if your email server is blocking emails from VETtrak's IP address 103.102.118.1 [2][5].

If the customer is using Office365 or Gmail, you can compare the details they\u2019ve got configured with the examples in the\n\nCloud Service Email Settings article to see whether anything is off. In the majority of cases you would expect that either an Office365 or\n\nGmail server setup would adhere to the details listed in that article as they are standardised.\n\nIn cases where a customer is using an SMTP Relay or a mail service other than Gmail or Office365, it is hard to tell whether the details they\n\nhave configured are correct. This usually calls for getting their IT team or Mail server admin involved but there are a few things you can in\n\norder to troubleshoot this.\n\nThe example below shows an SMTP relay set up for Office365, typically a set up like this would be sending from port 25, port 587 usually\n\nrequires the SSL/TLS connection method to be set to explicit and also requires the mail to be authenticated.\n\n55\n\nIn essence, even without standardised details it is worth keeping an eye out for anything that may be off within an SMTP configuration as a\n\nfirst point of call.\n\nIf everything seems to be in order with their SMTP details, the next step is to send a test email from within VETtrak - this will bring up an", "metadata": {"title": "VT Desktop Confluence Pages - PDF.txt", "link": "TBD", "category": "VT-Desktop"}}, {"rank": "9", "source": "confluence", "content": "provide them with the IP address: 103.102.118.1.

Based on the details provided, it appears that the staff member is unable to send emails from VETtrak, and the sent emails are not appearing in the Sent Items folder.\n\nHere are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:\n\n1. Ensure that the email settings in VETtrak are configured correctly. Check the Global Preferences > Email Preferences section and verify that the SMTP server settings and the default \"From\" email address are accurate [1].\n\n2. Check if the staff member has the necessary permissions to send emails from VETtrak. The \"Email Preferences\" section in Global Preferences allows you to configure email permissions for different staff types [3].\n\n3. Try clearing the browser cache and cookies, and then log back into VETtrak. Sometimes, cached data can cause issues with email functionality.\n\n4. If the issue persists, you can try sending a test email from VETtrak to your own email address to isolate the issue further.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the problem, please provide me with more details, such as screenshots of the error message or any specific error codes you're encountering.

Check if other users in your organization are facing similar issues with sending emails from VETtrak. If not, the issue may be specific to your user account or workstation.\n\n3. Try sending a test email from VETtrak to your own email address to see if the issue is specific to the non-attendance emails or if it's a general email sending issue.\n\n4. If the test email is successful, there may be an issue with the specific non-attendance email process. In this case, I would suggest checking the email templates and any related configurations for non-attendance emails.\n\n5. If the test email is also not being sent, there may be a connectivity issue or a problem with the email server settings. You can try restarting the VETtrak application and your workstation to see if that resolves the issue.\n\nIf the problem persists after trying these troubleshooting steps, please provide the screenshot of the error message as requested, and I'll be happy to investigate further.

We are having issues when enrolments are coming through and selecting Purchase Order as their payment method. We are receiving a PO Number, but not employer details.

The notification preferences in the Trainer Portal are focused on receiving notifications within the portal itself when students upload documents or send direct messages, rather than handling external email replies.\n\nSo while trainers can send emails to students from the Trainer Portal, any replies from students would go to the trainer's regular email inbox outside of the portal. The Trainer Portal itself does not have a dedicated email inbox to receive those replies.\n\nIf being able to have a centralized communication flow between trainers and students via email is a desired functionality, I would suggest submitting a feature request to the product team for consideration in future updates.

If the customer is using Office365 or Gmail, you can compare the details they\u2019ve got configured with the examples in the\n\nCloud Service Email Settings article to see whether anything is off. In the majority of cases you would expect that either an Office365 or\n\nGmail server setup would adhere to the details listed in that article as they are standardised.\n\nIn cases where a customer is using an SMTP Relay or a mail service other than Gmail or Office365, it is hard to tell whether the details they\n\nhave configured are correct. This usually calls for getting their IT team or Mail server admin involved but there are a few things you can in\n\norder to troubleshoot this.\n\nThe example below shows an SMTP relay set up for Office365, typically a set up like this would be sending from port 25, port 587 usually\n\nrequires the SSL/TLS connection method to be set to explicit and also requires the mail to be authenticated.\n\n55\n\nIn essence, even without standardised details it is worth keeping an eye out for anything that may be off within an SMTP configuration as a\n\nfirst point of call.\n\nIf everything seems to be in order with their SMTP details, the next step is to send a test email from within VETtrak - this will bring up an", "metadata": {"title": "VT Desktop Confluence Pages - PDF.txt", "link": "TBD", "category": "VT-Desktop"}}, {"rank": "7", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "Course's progress based on its enrolments.

This new Purge Documents process will allow users to permanently purge documents from the VETenrol file storage bucket. Once deleted it is not possible to recover these files.

For users who have the VTDocs API configured, this process will NOT delete documents pushed from VETenrol and stored in VTDocs, only the local VETenrol copy will be removed. CRICOS number: We have updated the secure payment process to include the CRICOS number on the secure payment page footer.

If you're using multi-factor authentication or an application-specific password for the email account, ensure the correct password is entered in VETtrak's Email Preferences [3].\n\n4. Check if there are any firewall, antivirus, or security software rules that could be blocking VETtrak's connection to the mail server [1].\n\n5. If you have VETtrak Security enabled and want each staff member to use their individual email account, ensure their email credentials are correctly configured in the Staff Manager [4].\n\nIf you continue to experience issues after trying these steps, please provide the specific error messages or log details, and I'll be happy to further investigate.

This usually calls for getting their IT team or Mail server admin involved but there are a few things you can in\n\norder to troubleshoot this.\n\nThe example below shows an SMTP relay set up for Office365, typically a set up like this would be sending from port 25, port 587 usually\n\nrequires the SSL/TLS connection method to be set to explicit and also requires the mail to be authenticated.\n\n55\n\nIn essence, even without standardised details it is worth keeping an eye out for anything that may be off within an SMTP configuration as a\n\nfirst point of call.\n\nIf everything seems to be in order with their SMTP details, the next step is to send a test email from within VETtrak - this will bring up an", "metadata": {"title": "VT Desktop Confluence Pages - PDF.txt", "link": "TBD", "category": "VT-Desktop"}}, {"rank": "9", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "Portal SMTP override options\n\nMust be running VETtrak version 18.3.0.x (or higher)  and Trainer Portal v18.3.0.2 (or higher)  or Student Portal v18.3.0.2 (or higher)  It is important that an experienced IT resource is available to manage this process.

The length of time is generous, for example a user could leave it to make a coffee without concern, however if it is left overnight, there will likely be an error if they try to continue with it in the morning. The participant is trying to return to their registration, or to VETenrol in general, using a favourited/bookmarked link. Essentially the same as the above, since once a user visits VETenrol with a valid link the URL is replaced with the session link. If the user saves that link with the intention of returning later they're essentially leaving it \"unattended\" and the session will expire. The VETtrak API timeout period has been exceeded. VETenrol authenticates with the API in order to communicate with VETtrak through-out the session. Successful authentication issues a token to VETenrol which is like a free pass to keep using the API, but there is an expiry and access attempts after that will result in an error. For security, a participant generally must complete their registration in the one sitting and in a timely manner unless they make use of the Save for Later feature. They must use a valid link to reach VETenrol, such as from your website or their Save For Later email, and not a link saved from a previous visit or found in their browser history.", "metadata": {"title": "VT-Desktop_51000288366.txt", "link": "https://help-vettrak.readytech.io/support/solutions/articles/51000288366", "category": "VT-Desktop"}}, {"rank": "4", "source": "confluence", "content": "Stripe Dashboard->Developers to see this info.\n\nPayment Gateway surcharges and additional fees\n\nThere are no additional fees or surcharges, regardless of the payment method used by registrants.

If the customer is using Office365 or Gmail, you can compare the details they\u2019ve got configured with the examples in the\n\nCloud Service Email Settings article to see whether anything is off. In the majority of cases you would expect that either an Office365 or\n\nGmail server setup would adhere to the details listed in that article as they are standardised.\n\nIn cases where a customer is using an SMTP Relay or a mail service other than Gmail or Office365, it is hard to tell whether the details they\n\nhave configured are correct. This usually calls for getting their IT team or Mail server admin involved but there are a few things you can in\n\norder to troubleshoot this.\n\nThe example below shows an SMTP relay set up for Office365, typically a set up like this would be sending from port 25, port 587 usually\n\nrequires the SSL/TLS connection method to be set to explicit and also requires the mail to be authenticated.\n\n55\n\nIn essence, even without standardised details it is worth keeping an eye out for anything that may be off within an SMTP configuration as a\n\nfirst point of call.\n\nIf everything seems to be in order with their SMTP details, the next step is to send a test email from within VETtrak - this will bring up an", "metadata": {"title": "VT Desktop Confluence Pages - PDF.txt", "link": "TBD", "category": "VT-Desktop"}}, {"rank": "6", "source": "confluence", "content": "DELTA Registration System where the RTO has been given access.\n\nRelated fields\n\nIf the value in the Funding Source Identifier - State Training Authority field is specific to apprentices/trainees (e.g. ASL, L, LCP, LQ, LSG,\n\nQIL, RWL, WTL, YCL, YRL or Z55) then ensure the following fields are not blank:\n\nClient Identifier - Apprenticeships (Client Identifier \u2013 Australian Apprenticeships)\n\nTraining Contract Identifier (Training Contract Identifier - Australian Apprenticeships).116\n\n[VT_Error] Failed To Send One Or More VETEnrol Email Notifications\n\nThe below is an example of an email customers using VETernol may get.

I m not sure data insights is sophisticated enough to get the information I need, but I will give a bit of an outline and you can point me in the right direction. We have a number of units probably around *** that are superseded but equivalent to current units. I need to locate students that have completed the superseded unit that have a current enrolment. At the moment we do this manually by running a report one at a time for each unit. Which as you can imagine is incredibly time consuming. The data insight I am trying to set up is to locate students with a current enrolment that also have had a completed enrolment in a previous year, I figure it will probably be quicker to look per student than per unit. This is the data insight I have set up but I am not getting any results, so something is obviously not quite right, or is it more the case of the data insight cannot perform this functionality? cid:image***.png@**DA*A**.D*E**D** Kind Regards ****** cid:flexirtologoforemail b***cbf* *e** **** **e* ***b**d*dc*c.png              ************** Manager Flexi RTO  RTO ***** Phone: ************ Mobile: ************ Email: ***************************** Web: ****************** *************************** We respectfully acknowledge the traditional owners, past and present, of the land on which we work and live.\n\nThis email and any attachments are confidential and are only for the use of the intended recipient.

The QLD purchasing contracts can also be managed from Configuration Manager > Purchasing Contracts > Queensland [3][2].\n\n4. For SA purchasing contracts, these are required fields that RTOs receive from the government. You can add and view them under Configuration Manager > Purchasing Contracts > South Australia [3][2].\n\n5.

This involves specifying details like the field name, data type (text, number, date etc.), any validation rules, and setting it as applicable to the Client Enrolment entity [4].\n\nUpdating the custom field values in bulk:\nOnce the new custom field is created, I can then update its values in bulk for existing enrolments using the VETtrak API [3][6][5]. The API provides functions to query and update the additional data fields, including custom fields, for different entities like enrolments.\n\nTo do this bulk update, I will first query the enrolments you want updated using the EnrolmentID values provided in the attached spreadsheet. I can then use the UpdateAdditionalDataForWebRecord API function to set the new custom field value for each of those enrolment records [3][6][5].\n\nPlease confirm if you would like me to proceed with creating the new custom field and performing the bulk update as described. If so, I'll need the following information:\n\n1. The desired name and data type for the new custom field\n2. Any specific validation rules or settings needed for the field \n3. A spreadsheet/CSV with the EnrolmentID and desired custom field value for each enrolment to update\n\nLet me know if you need any other details!

This can certainly cause issues with attendance tracking and communication with employers [1].\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that classes are being properly scheduled initially, but then some of them disappear unexpectedly. There could be a few potential reasons for this:\n\n1. Classes cannot be deleted if attendance has already been recorded for them. If someone tries to delete a class with recorded attendance, it will not actually be deleted but may appear to be missing [1]. To resolve this, you would need to first remove any recorded attendance before deleting the class.\n\n2. An issue or bug could be causing scheduled classes to be unintentionally removed from the system [3]. VETtrak releases regular updates to fix bugs, so ensuring you are on the latest version may resolve the issue.\n\n3. User permissions and security settings could be preventing certain users from viewing or accessing scheduled classes [2]. Double check that all relevant users have the appropriate permissions to view and manage classes.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Check if any attendance has been recorded for the missing classes. If so, remove that attendance first before attempting to reschedule or delete the class.\n\n2. Ensure you are using the latest version of VETtrak by checking for any available updates.\n\n3. Review user permissions and security settings to confirm relevant staff can properly view and manage scheduled classes.\n\n4. Try rescheduling or recreating the missing classes to see if the issue persists.\n\nIf the problem continues after trying these steps, please let me know and I can further investigate potential causes or workarounds. Keeping an accurate class schedule is crucial for attendance tracking and communication with students and employers [1][2]."}, {"id": 1, "answer": "Hi there,\n\nThank you for reaching out about the issue with scheduled classes disappearing unexpectedly. This can certainly cause disruptions in attendance tracking and create issues for students and employers [1].\n\nClasses in VETtrak are typically scheduled within an Occurrence by either adding them individually or using the Class Wizard to schedule multiple classes at once [2]. Once scheduled, classes should remain in the system unless they are intentionally deleted or moved.\n\nThere could be a few potential reasons why scheduled classes are disappearing:\n\n1. Classes may have been accidentally deleted, either one-by-one or in bulk using the \"Delete Selected Classes\" option [1]. Deleting classes with recorded attendance is not allowed, so this is likely not the cause if attendance was already recorded.\n\n2. The entire Occurrence containing the classes may have been moved to a different date using the \"Move Occurrence\" function [4]. This would reschedule all classes to the new dates, so the original class dates would no longer appear.\n\n3. There could be an issue or bug in the system causing scheduled classes to be unexpectedly removed [3].\n\nTo prevent accidental removal, I would recommend double-checking that no one is deleting or moving classes unintentionally. You can also check the global preferences to see if any settings related to class management have been changed recently [3].\n\nIf the issue persists after verifying the above, I suggest contacting our support team to further investigate this unexpected behavior and determine if there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. Please provide specific examples and details to help troubleshoot the problem more effectively.\n\nLet me know if you need any other assistance!\n\nKind Regards,"}, {"id": 2, "answer": "Hi there,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding the issue with classes disappearing from students' schedules. This can indeed cause issues with attendance tracking and employer notifications [5].\n\nClasses are typically scheduled for an occurrence (batch of students) through the Programme Manager by adding class details like dates, times, staff, rooms, etc. [2] These scheduled classes then appear on the individual students' schedules in the Student Portal [6].\n\nThere are a few potential reasons why scheduled classes may go missing:\n\n1. Classes were deleted or removed from the occurrence schedule [1]. Once attendance is recorded for a class, it cannot be deleted, so this could explain some but not all missing classes.\n\n2. The occurrence itself was moved to different dates, which would shift all associated classes [4]. However, this should still maintain the classes, just on the new dates.\n\n3. A bug or system issue caused classes to be unexpectedly removed [5]. Our team regularly releases fixes for any such issues found.\n\nTo resolve the immediate issue, I would suggest reviewing the occurrence schedule in the Programme Manager to verify if the missing classes are still present [2]. If not, you may need to re-add them to the schedule.\n\nGoing forward, here are some best practices to prevent this issue:\n\n- Avoid deleting or removing scheduled classes unless absolutely necessary [1]\n- Exercise caution when moving occurrences to new dates [4] \n- Keep systems updated to the latest version which includes bug fixes [5]\n- Routinely cross-check student schedules against the master occurrence schedule [6][7]\n\nPlease let me know if the issue persists after taking these steps.

Based on the information in our help documentation, it is possible to undo or revert an enrolment transfer [1].\n\nThe process for undoing a transferred enrolment involves first cancelling the new \"transferred\" enrolment, and then reactivating the original enrolment in the old occurrence [2]. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Locate the new transferred enrolment and cancel/remove it.\n2. Go to the original occurrence where the enrolment was previously, and reactivate the enrolment there.\n3. If the student had any attendance or results recorded in the original occurrence, those will remain intact after reactivating the enrolment.\n4. Any payments or invoices associated with the original enrolment will also be reinstated when you reactivate it.\n\nPlease note that if the student had results recorded in the new transferred enrolment, those results will be lost when cancelling that enrolment [1].

I understand the situation and can provide some guidance.\n\nWhen a student's enrolment is cancelled in an occurrence, the system prevents re-enrolling them into the same occurrence to avoid duplicate enrolments [2]. However, there is a process to transfer the cancelled enrolment to a new occurrence, which will allow re-enrolling the student [1].\n\nHere are the steps to transfer the cancelled enrolment:\n\n1. Open the occurrence and right-click on the student's cancelled enrolment.\n2. Select \"Transfer enrolment\" to launch the Transfer Enrolment Wizard.\n3. In the wizard, select a new future-dated occurrence to transfer the enrolment to.\n4. Complete the wizard, ensuring any attendance records, payments, etc. are carried over.\n\nThis will cancel the original enrolment, transfer it to the new occurrence, and allow you to re-enroll the student into that new occurrence [1].\n\nIf the transfer was unsuccessful due to recorded units in the original enrolment, you can try the following:\n\n1. Run an Enrolment Report for the student to save their existing results.\n2. Remove any recorded results from the original enrolment.\n3. Then attempt the transfer process again.\n\nYou can re-enter the results in the new transferred enrolment after completing the transfer [1][4].\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, please let me know.\n\nThank you,"}, {"id": 1, "answer": "Hi,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding the issue with re-enrolling a student into the same occurrence after their previous enrolment was cancelled. I understand the situation and have a potential solution for you.\n\nBased on the references [2][1], it seems that the best approach would be to transfer the student's previous enrolment to a new occurrence. This will allow you to create a fresh enrolment for the student in the original occurrence without any conflicts.\n\nHere are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. Create a new occurrence for the same qualification [3]. This can be an inactive or dummy occurrence, as it's only meant to hold the previous enrolment data temporarily.\n\n2. Use the \"Transfer Enrolment\" option to move the student's previous enrolment from the original occurrence to the newly created occurrence [1].\n\n3. Once the transfer is complete, you should be able to enroll the student into the original occurrence without any issues.\n\nBy transferring the previous enrolment to a separate occurrence, you are essentially clearing the way for a new enrolment in the original occurrence without any conflicting data.\n\nPlease note that if the student had any results recorded in the previous enrolment, those results will not be transferred to the new enrolment [1]. You may need to re-enter those results manually or run an enrolment report to have a record of the previous results [1].\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with this process.\n\nThank you,"}, {"id": 2, "answer": "Hi,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding the issue with re-enrolling a student into the same occurrence after their previous enrolment was cancelled. I understand the situation where a student cancels their training contract but wants to resume the same qualification after some time.\n\nBased on the information provided in references [2] and [1], it is possible to transfer an occurrence enrolment to a new occurrence, even if the student has attendance and completed units recorded in the original occurrence. The process involves using the \"Transfer Enrolment\" option from the right-click menu on the student's enrolment. This will open the Transfer Enrolment Wizard, allowing you to select a new occurrence to transfer the enrolment to.\n\nDuring the transfer process, any existing attendance records and completed units in the old occurrence will remain intact. However, the student will be automatically removed from any future classes in the old occurrence [2]. If the student had an invoice in the old occurrence, it will be automatically credited out and the funds moved to a holding account, which can then be applied to an invoice in the new occurrence [2][1].\n\nIt's important to note that if the student has results recorded in the original enrolment, you will need to remove those results before proceeding with the transfer [1]. You can run and save an Enrolment Report for the client to have a record of the previously entered results, which can be re-entered after the transfer is complete.\n\nAdditionally, reference [3] mentions that when recording occurrence results for a unit, VETtrak will validate that you are not recording the same result more than once for the same client in the same unit, which can occur if you are using linked enrolments. This validation helps when recording results for dual qualifications or re-enrolments.\n\nIn summary, to re-enroll the student into the same occurrence after their previous enrolment was cancelled, you can use the Transfer Enrolment feature to move the enrolment to a new occurrence, even if the student had completed units in the original enrolment. This will allow you to continue their training from where they left off while creating a new enrolment record.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or have additional questions.\n\nKind regards,"}], "related_knowledge": [{"rank": "1", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "Process: Transfer an Occurrence Enrolment (inc.

Programs in VETtrak can represent training activities that are not linked to a full qualification or course structure. You can create a new program specifically for the Red Card to White Card transfer, without needing to set up occurrences, classes or date ranges [1].\n\nTo allow clients to initiate the transfer process and make payments, you can take advantage of the web enrolment and online payment integration features in VETtrak [2][3]. Here are the suggested steps:\n\n1. Set up the new Red Card to White Card transfer program in VETtrak.\n2. Configure online payment settings to allow clients to purchase this program through your website [3]. \n3. Set up a web enrolment form on your website that links to this new program in VETtrak [2][3]. Clients can complete this form and submit payment to initiate their transfer request.\n4. Their form submission will create a new \"enrolment\" record in VETtrak for this program, allowing you to track their request and payment [1][2].\n\nYou can customize the web enrolment form fields to capture any specific information needed for the transfer process [2]. The enrolment record in VETtrak will contain the client's details and payment information [1].\n\nLet me know if you need any other assistance in setting this up. I'd be happy to provide more specific guidance once you have the new program created."}, {"id": 1, "answer": "Hi [name],\n\nThank you for your request regarding setting up the Red Card to White Card transfer service in VETtrak. For services that are not typical training courses, you have a couple of options in VETtrak:\n\n1. You can create a \"Unit/Module only\" enrolment for the client [1]. This allows you to enrol the client without linking to a full qualification or course. You can add pricing details during the enrolment creation process.\n\n2. You can add the service as a custom product or \"other fee\" item in VETtrak [2]. This allows you to record client details, assign the product/fee to their record, and take payment.\n\nEither of these options would allow you to capture the client's information and payment details in VETtrak for the Red Card to White Card transfer service, without needing to set up an occurrence, class schedule, etc.\n\nI'd recommend exploring both options to see which workflow works better for your processes. Let me know if you need any assistance setting up either the enrolment or custom product approach.\n\nKind regards,"}, {"id": 2, "answer": "Hi [client name],\n\nThank you for your inquiry about setting up a new service for clients to transfer from a Red Card to a White Card (Construction Induction).\n\nBased on your requirements, it seems that creating a new program in VETtrak would be the best approach [1]. Programs in VETtrak can represent training activities that do not necessarily need to be linked to a qualification or course.

When creating the program, you can leave out the details related to occurrences, classes, and date ranges, as they are not applicable for this service.\n\nAdditionally, VETtrak allows you to create custom forms and link them to specific programs or enrolments [2]. If you need to collect additional information from clients as part of the Red Card to White Card transfer process, you can create a custom form and associate it with the new program you set up.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance with setting up the new program or creating custom forms in VETtrak.
