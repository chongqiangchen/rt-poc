If you would like to set up a more automated process, see the ReadySMS Automated Workflows article. Manual workflows are designed to be used without the course forms feature of the SMS.\n\nReadySMS Manual Workflows\n\nThree options exist for the manual applications and enrolments process. The first can be used for simple individual student enrolment and the second for simple bulk enrolment. The third workflow uses a manual, paper application process, but then leverages some simple automations within the system to manage the application (e.g. automates emails to students).\n\nOverview of the Workflows\n\n1. Manual Individual Enrolment This process involves student's applying for a course using a paper application form. Upon receipt of this form, a student party record is created manually. The student can then be processed through the enrolment wizard and a payment can be taken. For this process, any communication with the student must be performed manually and admin notifications are not available.\n\n2. Manual Bulk Enrolment The manual bulk enrolment process uses paper applications for initial student applications. Upon receipt of this form, a student party record is created manually. After the desired number of applications are completed and party records made, a bulk enrolment step can be performed to process students into courses. Payments can be taken following the enrolment step.", "metadata": {"title": "JR-Plus_51000334800.txt", "link": "https://help-education.readytech.io/support/solutions/articles/51000334800", "category": "JR-Plus"}}, {"rank": "2", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "New Trainer Role \u2013 Access all parties  We have added a new System Role for trainers '- access_to_all_parties' that can be enabled in the Administration > Security area.

Address related changes  Address Format  We have updated Party and Host screens to better support different address types. Users are now able to choose which type of address format to save, \u2018Basic\u2019 or \u2018Detailed\u2019. The \u2018Basic\u2019 address format is the standard used in postage, whereby the unit number, street number and street name are stored and presented as a single field. This is ideal for those providers that want to integrate with third-party CRMs via API. The \u2018Detailed\u2019 address format records each of the elements that form an address as individual fields. This is the required address format for AVETMISS reporting. Address Format Preferences  System administrators can configure which address formats are used for new addresses in the system under Administration > Configuration > Preferences > Preferences/Settings.

Within the Course in Canvas, each assessment (Quiz, Assignment or Assessment) will be mapped to a Unit that a student is enrolled in. These must have the Unit Identifier within brackets so we can determine student competency when transferring the results. I.e., \u201cWritten Assessment (BSBLDR501)\u201d.

Our goal is to incorporate a pre-enrollment form that is triggered when a customer purchases a course from our website. Upon purchasing course(s), we envision an automated email being sent to the customer, containing a VTCloud pre-enrollment form. This form would already include the courses they have purchased, and the customer would simply need to provide basic information such as their name, email address, and phone number. Alternatively, when a customer buys course(s), we would like the pre-enrollment form to appear,  like a redirect when they finished  the purchase, allowing them to provide details for each attendee.\n\nWe kindly request your assistance in further exploring this idea and understanding how the pre-enrollment process can be implemented in our specific case.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\n-- **************** Web Developer QMS Audits Pty Ltd QMS Audits Training Pty Ltd\n\nOffice: ***********\n\nMob: ***\n\n******\n\nABN: *\n\n**********\n\n/ *\n\n**********\n\nRTO#: *****\n\n[/var/folders/qf/**\n\nypnvs\n\nllbf\n\ndlk\n\nsxqfph***\n\ngn/T/com.microsoft.Outlook/WebArchiveCopyPasteTempFiles/cidimage**\n\n.png@*\n\nD*\n\nA\n\nD.F*\n\nF***\n\n]<*************************************\n\n>\n\nClick here to see\n\nour <*************************************\n\n> HACCP Training<*************************************\n\n>", "metadata": {"title": "JR-Plus_46586.txt", "link": "https://help-education.readytech.io/a/tickets/46586", "category": "JR-Plus"}}, {"rank": "102", "source": "ticket", "content": "Ticket Subject: Short courses\n\nGood afternoon Vettrak Support, I am after some information on how to set up an accredited short course in Vettrak.

I understand the urgency given the impact on your enrollment process.\n\nBased on your description, it seems the course start date is displaying incorrectly specifically on the application form, despite being correct elsewhere in the system [2]. This could potentially be due to a configuration issue with how the start date is being pulled into the application form [1].\n\nTo resolve this, I would first recommend double-checking the application form settings to ensure the correct date field is being referenced for the start date [1]. If the settings appear correct, you may need to clear the application form cache to force it to re-pull the updated start date.\n\nIf neither of those steps resolve the issue, please let me know and I can further investigate potential root causes and solutions.

I understand the urgency given the impact it is having on your enrollment process.\n\nThe course start date displayed on the application form should match what is set at the course level [2]. However, there are a few potential reasons why a mismatch could occur:\n\n1. The application form may be inheriting the start date from the event series rather than the course itself. You can check the form settings to see if it is configured to inherit dates from events or the course [1].\n\n2. If the form was created some time ago, it may be pulling an old/cached start date that is no longer current. Try clearing the cache and refreshing the form.\n\n3. There could be some custom coding or configurations on the form that are overriding the default start date value. I'd need to investigate the form setup to identify any customizations.\n\nTo resolve this, I recommend first checking the form settings to understand where it is pulling the start date from and if it matches your intended configuration [1]. If the settings look correct, please let me know and I can further investigate potential causes for the mismatch.\n\nIn the meantime, you could consider adding a note to the form clarifying the correct start date to reduce confusion for applicants.

Here, students apply using a manual application and party records are manual added to the system. The manual course application feature (Courses > Applications >new application) is then used to add applications into the Kanban for processing. The benefit of this is that it allows for automated emails to be sent to students based on their position in the application process. This process is recommended when you have to take manual applications for large numbers of students.

You can use the fields in these forms to collect information from an individual. The Form Builder lets you define the fields you include, which will affect the data you can collect. Using the Form Builder  Depending on your institution, and the types of data you collect, it will affect the fields you include in your report. Due to the uniqueness of each application, we are unable to provide an exact step-by-step process. Instead, we plan to use this article to break down how each part of the Form Builder works. From here, you will have the knowledge you need to create a form.\n\nForm 'Fields' Tab  The Form Fields in the form builder have been broken down into five key sections:   Basic - These are fields used to collect custom data. These fields are not linked to a specific field in the Party Record or used for National/State reporting purposes. Party Identity Data - These fields are linked to specific areas within the Party record. This information is typically collected for National/State reporting purposes. Compliance Data - These fields are for the collection of data required for State Reporting/Funding. International - These fields are typically used for collecting specific data relevant to international students. Reference Data - These fields exist for data collection only. They use the data that already exists within the Reference Data Tables. For example, you may wish to collect the Gender of a Student's Emergency Contact. The Gender field in the Reference Data section lets you use the drop-down options available for that kind of field.\n\nForm 'Styles' Tab  You can use Form Styles to format the content that exists within the form. For example, to change the font size, highlight the text you wish to change and then adjust the Font Size option under the Styles Tab.", "metadata": {"title": "JR-Plus_51000289601.txt", "link": "https://help-education.readytech.io/support/solutions/articles/51000289601", "category": "JR-Plus"}}, {"rank": "3", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "Previously you could proceed with the import if there were no errors on the first page but any errors on subsequent pages were not brought to the attention of the user. 25365 - When reporting eCAF clients, we now report middle name of a student separately to align with the new eCAF reporting standard. 25344 - We have improved the accuracy of the Search by Event from the Progress Centre->Attendance page. 25116 - We have implemented some improvements to the form builder so that deleting questions with associated questions those conditions will be deleted at the same time. 17900 - We have made an amendment that will disable the Pay Now button when an invoice has not been generated against a payment option.", "metadata": {"title": "JR-Plus_51000331054.txt", "link": "https://help-education.readytech.io/support/solutions/articles/51000331054", "category": "JR-Plus"}}, {"rank": "4", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "Click, + New.

Course Forms enable each organisation to design its own application or enrolment form and publish online via our portals and their own website. All four ReadySMS Workflows utilise Course Forms. The online forms are created using our easy-to-use user interface and can fully replace paper-based systems. The key features include:    The capture of regulatory data    Mandatory/non mandatory fields    Customisable questions, including:    Multiple choice    Tags/Properties    Dropdown    Short and paragraph questions    Rating questions      File uploads functionality    Partial form saving for later completion Search and selection of single or multiple programs    Secure payments through the integration of a payment gateway    Course Forms also allow enrolments to be either auto-confirmed or sent through to the application centre for additional vetting. When used in conjunction with the student portal, applicants will be able to view all their current applications and the corresponding status. All information captured through Course Forms is automatically uploaded into your student management system.

Once you have decided to try a 3rd Party SMTP email provider, check the pricing and sign up for an account. You will then need to authenticate the \"Sending\" domain before you can use the SMTP server. How to Authenticate the \"Sending\" domain? Your 3rd party SMTP provider will give you instructions on how to authenticate the sending domain. This normally involves creating some DNS records for the domain that the SMTP provider will verify. You should always use a subdomain or a brand new domain for sending your emails through the 3rd party SMTP server. Mixing a 3rd party SMTP server with your existing one is much harder to setup and will likely damage your ESP reputation. Option #1: Subdomain  A subdomain is a great option if you are wanting to increase the deliverability of your emails. You will need to request this through your IT team and is normally free of charge. For example, if your domain is myrto.edu.au a subdomain for sending your VETtrak emails could be vt.myrto.edu.au. Remember to use a \"Reply To\" address that your recipients can use to send replies to a monitored inbox. Option #2: New Domain  A new domain for sending emails may be required for organisations that have strict security requirements around the management/changes to their domain. You may also like to do this for testing/learning purposes.\n\nExample - metrainyou.cf  As an example, I have used the free domain registration service https://www.freenom.com to register the domain metrainyou.cf as my fictional RTO domain.

When reporting a discontinued student, if the student has not commenced training for a particular unit, then that unit should be left with a blank result and the \"Training Status\" field for the enrolment should be set to \"Training not completed\" to report TNC in the \"Outcome Identifier - Training Organisation\" field in the NAT120 file [2].\n\nTo properly configure and report the TNC outcome code:\n\n1. For units where the student has not started training, leave the result field blank and set the unit start and end dates to the past.\n2. Set the \"Training Status\" field for the enrolment to \"Training not completed\".\n3. In the NAT120 file, the \"Outcome Identifier - Training Organisation\" field will then populate with TNC for all units in that enrolment [3].\n\nThis will ensure that your next STS online upload correctly reports students who have discontinued training using the TNC outcome code, resolving the previous data anomaly.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification regarding the usage and reporting of the TNC outcome code."}, {"id": 1, "answer": "Hi,\n\nThank you for reaching out regarding the use of the \"Training Not Completed (TNC)\" outcome code for reporting discontinued students in NSW Smart and Skilled reporting.\n\nBased on the NSW Smart and Skilled eReporting Technical Specifications and Business Validation User Guide [1], the TNC outcome code should be used in the \"Outcome identifier - training organisation\" field (position 112) of the NAT120 file to indicate that a student has discontinued all training in the qualification or course, not just a single unit of competency.\n\nThe guide specifies that for discontinued students, the value \"TNC\" should be used, while \"D\" is used for deferred students [1]. This value must be reported consistently across all units for the discontinued qualification/course enrolment.\n\nYour understanding is correct - using the \"Withdrawn\" outcome code was not appropriate for reporting discontinued students in NSW. The TNC code is the designated outcome to report when a student has not completed their enrolled qualification/course [1][3][2].\n\nSo in summary, to correctly report discontinued students for NSW Smart and Skilled in your next STS online upload, you should configure the outcome as \"Training Not Completed (TNC)\" in the Outcomes Types configuration as shown in your screenshot.

My sincere apologies for the inconvenience. The development team had been working on it and we hope to get it resolved soon.\n\nI have noticed due to the recent update we are experiencing a few enrolment issues    earlier we can sort the dates once and it stays the same for every student at the student s profile at the course level however after the update if we have to sort the dates but we have to act that for each learner. Thank you for bringing this up to our attention. This could possibly be linked to a bug detected recently that does not retain the sorting orders, and we had sent it for the developer s review not too long  ago.

This separation is intentional and aligns with the AVETMISS reporting requirements, as fee-for-service (FFS) enrolments and government-funded enrolments often have different reporting criteria and submission processes.\n\nGenerating a single AVETMISS file that combines both types of enrolments could potentially lead to compliance issues or data integrity problems, as the reporting rules and validations may differ between FFS and funded enrolments [2]. It is recommended to generate separate AVETMISS files for FFS and funded enrolments to ensure accurate and compliant reporting.\n\nHowever, if your primary goal is to have a consolidated view of all enrolment data for internal purposes, you can explore the custom reporting functionality within the SMS. Custom reports can be configured to include both FFS and funded enrolments, allowing you to extract and analyze the combined data as needed [2].\n\nAlternatively, you can consider generating separate AVETMISS files for FFS and funded enrolments, and then merge or consolidate the data externally using third-party tools or scripts, depending on your specific requirements.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if you need assistance with configuring custom reports or exploring other options within the SMS."}, {"id": 2, "answer": "Hi,\n\nThank you for your inquiry regarding generating a single AVETMISS file that includes both enrolments with claiming enabled and enrolments without a contract assigned.\n\nThe AVETMISS Reporting wizard in our software currently requires selecting either \"Include Only Enrolments With Claiming Enabled\" or \"Include Enrolments Without a Contract\" [1].

In this article, we will go over how to enable MFA in your system. TABLE OF CONTENTS   What is Multi-Factor Authentication? Activating Multi-Factor Authentication  Disabling Multi-Factor Authentication for a User     What is Multi-Factor Authentication? MFA is a security measure that requires you to provide a combination of things to verify your identity. Typically, it requires a combination of a two or more of the following factors at the time of sign in:   Something that you know (password, PIN, passphrase, security question)\n\nSomething that you have (authenticator app, SMS, email, physical token)  Something that you are (fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scan)   Having MFA enabled provides you with much more protection against bad actors trying to access your account. Even if they were to gain access to one piece of information (for example, your password), they will need to obtain other required information to gain access to your account.\n\nThis provides extra layers of security and makes it much less likely that your account will be compromised. Your Student Management System supports MFA via the use of an authenticator app on your mobile device. Some popular choices for MFA authenticator apps are:   Google Authenticator  Microsoft Authenticator  2FAS     Activating Multi-Factor Authentication  MFA needs to be enabled on a per user basis and only the user themselves can set it up. After logging into your account, click on your Profile at the top right corner and click on Preferences. You will now be on the Preferences\n\npage for your user account.

Based on the information in our help documentation, there are a couple of ways to approach this:\n\n1. You can use the Enrolment List page to bulk email students and update their email addresses [1][3]. On this page, you can search for and select the students you want to update, then use the \"Email\" bulk action to send an email prompting them to update their email address in the system. This would require the students to take action themselves.\n\n2. Alternatively, you can use the Unit Result Importer tool to bulk update enrolled unit details, including the student's email address [2]. This would involve preparing an Excel file with the updated email addresses mapped to the respective students and their enrolled units, then importing that file through the Unit Result Importer.\n\nWhen updating email addresses, the system will automatically set the new email as the primary contact email for that student.

In this article, we will go over how to enable MFA in your system. TABLE OF CONTENTS   What is Multi-Factor Authentication? Activating Multi-Factor Authentication  Disabling Multi-Factor Authentication for a User     What is Multi-Factor Authentication? MFA is a security measure that requires you to provide a combination of things to verify your identity. Typically, it requires a combination of a two or more of the following factors at the time of sign in:   Something that you know (password, PIN, passphrase, security question)\n\nSomething that you have (authenticator app, SMS, email, physical token)  Something that you are (fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scan)   Having MFA enabled provides you with much more protection against bad actors trying to access your account. Even if they were to gain access to one piece of information (for example, your password), they will need to obtain other required information to gain access to your account.\n\nThis provides extra layers of security and makes it much less likely that your account will be compromised. Your Student Management System supports MFA via the use of an authenticator app on your mobile device. Some popular choices for MFA authenticator apps are:   Google Authenticator  Microsoft Authenticator  2FAS     Activating Multi-Factor Authentication  MFA needs to be enabled on a per user basis and only the user themselves can set it up. After logging into your account, click on your Profile at the top right corner and click on Preferences. You will now be on the Preferences\n\npage for your user account.

In this article, we will go over the new changes and what you need to do to ensure that your reporting is correct. TABLE OF CONTENTS   Changes in the UI  Changes to Field Behaviour\n\nChanges to Reporting     Changes in the UI  There will be some changes to how Scheduled Hours and Hours Attended are recorded in the UI. To view the changes, go to any Enrolment \u2192 Units and click on the Advanced button next to a unit. You will notice that the Scheduled Hours/Delivered Hours fields have been removed from the unit details. Depending on which State the enrolment is in, you will see one of two things. The fields have been replaced with two new fields, Unit Scheduled Hours and Unit Hours Attended. This will occur if the enrolment is within any state that isn\u2019t South Australia. The fields have been replaced with one new field, Unit Actual Hours. This will occur if the enrolment is within South Australia.

You have two options for entering the information into the party profile form:    Simple Form: This will display only the most important fields for the party profile (such as names, contact details, address details, etc). This form is ideal for quickly creating a new party profile then entering more of their details later. Complete Form: This will display all available fields for the party profile. This form is best used for entering all necessary information for that person, especially if there are reporting requirements for their data. For the purpose of this article, we will be using the Complete Form to create our new party profile. Party Details        Title:\n\nThe title that the person goes by (Mr, Mrs, Ms, etc). First Name(s): The person\u2019s given name(s), this is a mandatory field. Surname:\n\nThe family name of the person. Middle Name(s): The person\u2019s given middle name(s). Known As:\n\nAny other names that the person goes by (for example, nicknames can be placed in this field). Gender: The gender of the person. Party Identifier: A unique alphanumeric value that is assigned to the party. This field should be left alone, as one will automatically be assigned when the party is created.

This Microsoft article explains how to configure an SMTP relay (Option 3 is recommended) [3]. Your mail server admin will also need to set up an SPF record containing VETtrak's server IP address (103.102.118.1) [2] for the relay to work properly.\n\nOnce the SMTP relay is configured, you can update the email settings in VETtrak's Global Preferences with the relay details instead of your local mail server settings.

Set up an SMTP relay within your Microsoft Office 365 tenant. This will allow VETtrak to bypass multi-factor authentication and send emails through the relay [1][2]. You will also need to set up an SPF record containing VETtrak's server IP address for the relay to work properly [1].\n\n2. If you are only using Microsoft Outlook for email and not other Microsoft products, you can configure OAuth 2.0 authentication in VETtrak's email preferences [4]. This will allow VETtrak to authenticate using OAuth instead of basic authentication.\n\n3. For Gmail accounts, you can generate an app-specific password and use that in VETtrak's email password field instead of your regular password [1][5].\n\nI'd recommend option 1 (setting up an SMTP relay) as the best solution if you want to continue using your Microsoft email account with VETtrak.

If an email in the list appears with a green status indicator, this indicates the email was sent successfully, even if others in the list are marked red. The error code and message are produced by the mail server in this case. The message is provided by the email server and thus messages will vary depending on the SMTP server that is being connected to, even for the same error.

We have recently enabled Multi Factor Authentication using Okta and so direct SMTP login to the Office *** mail servers is no longer possible and the previously suggested fix of using application passwords will not work because we are not using the Azure MFA system. My understanding of VETtrack is that it is hosted on your servers that users here remote desktop in to, is this correct? If this is the case then I can only see four solutions:   *. An SMTP relay solution is provided within VETtrack s systems   *. Outlook is installed on the hosted RDP servers so that this email client is used to authenticate and relay the emails   *. DSA set up an SMTP relay server of our own. Note that this will only work if the RDP servers  public IP remains the same to allow firewall rules   *. VETtrack is installed directly on DSA PCs for anyone needing to use it. Option two  Outlook  seems to be the fastest and easiest solution, I do not have a lot of experience with VETtrak s back end so I m not sure how viable option four is. I would prefer the two SMTP relay server options to be last resorts as it would not allow the emails being sent to be saved and tracked using the Office *** servers. If you have any other alternatives or experience with clients using Office *** with non Azure MFA I ll be happy to work with you on it.\n\n******************* IT Infrastructure Engineer T: ************ M: **** *** *** tel:**************** E: ************************ mailto:************************ W: ********************** ********** ************************************** cid:image***.png@**D****A. **E***B* cid:image***.png@**D****A. **E***B* DSA acknowledges the Traditional Owners of  the land on which we work.

This includes checks on results in use, etc.\n\nExample: 'This unit has a continuing result, but a finish date in the current year'\n\nThis communicates that any unit submitted for their final upload should have a finish date in the next year, because it cant be\n\ncontinuing in the current year (because the year is ending...)", "metadata": {"title": "VT Desktop Confluence Pages - PDF.txt", "link": "TBD", "category": "VT-Desktop"}}, {"rank": "2", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "Commencing Status/Commencing Program Identifier\n\nFor National and State AVETMISS reporting, a Commencing Program Identifier needs to be set for each enrolment. In VETtrak, this field is available in the Enrolment Wizard, and labelled Commencing Status.\n\nThe available options for this field are:   Commencing enrolment in a qualification or course (3) In most cases, if the enrolment commences in the current year, the commencing status should be '3'. Continuing enrolment in the qualification or course from a previous year (4) If the enrolment commenced in a previous year, the commencing status should be '4'. Unit of competency or module enrolment only (8) If, however the enrolment is not in a national accredited qualification, course or skill set, then the selection should be '8'.\n\nEnrolments Spanning Multiple Years. You do not need to manually change each of your enrolments from the 'Commencing' (3) status, to the 'Continuing' (4) status, as when it comes time to generate AVETMISS files, VETtrak has unique validation that will determine what value to report. When generating State AVETMISS files, if the enrolment start date is in the AVETMISS generation year, VETtrak will automatically report '3'. If the enrolment start date is in a previous year, then VETtrak will change the reported value to '4'. Note: For Victorian state AVETMISS generations, the Course Commencement Date (CCD) is used to make this decision, not the enrolment start date. It is important to note that this change does not actually change the value on the enrolment, all it does is ensure the correct value is populated into the AVETMISS files. This means, if you edit a Victorian enrolment which commenced last year, but still has a 'Commencing Status' of 'Commencing' (3), you will be forced to changed the value to 'Continuing' (4), before you can save your changes.

There are two ways of reporting your VET Student Loan data to TCSI \u2013 VETtrak allows you to use either of the following:   There is a file unload facility using TCSI reporting portal which involves extracting files from VETtrak and uploading to that portal. The other way is an automated way using TCSI API reporting. We strongly recommend that you use the API reporting method as it will be easier to use and it is also the TCSI preferred method of reporting. Once you choose the API method you cannot revert back to doing file uploads. Onboarding to the TCSI system is a managed process. VETtrak has developed a two stage approach to upgrading. The TCSI project are offering onboarding sessions for all VSL providers so you need to register and attend those as part of this process. We expect that you will have initiated or be ready to initiate your TCSI onboarding process by the time you come to the VETtrak setup. This guide will only detail the VETtrak specific actions required.

A: The USI is a mandatory field for AVETMISS reporting unless the client has a specific USI exemption granted by the USI scheme. We recommend first trying to contact the student to verify their details and enter them into VETtrak. If this is not possible there is a Find a Student USI page on the USI website that may be able to assist you with retrieving their student\u2019s USI. If you cannot retrieve the student\u2019s USI through these means please contact the USI office to understand how you can report this data. Once you understand how you need to report this data you can contact VETtrak Support at support@vettrak.io or 1800 VETTRAK for assistance using VETtrak to achieve this. Q: When amending the Continuing results using the Extend Unit End Dates (bulk) wizard, what date range do you enter to fix this? A: Within the Extend Unit Dates Wizard we suggest that you set the Finishing on/before to the end of the calendar year (31/12/2023), this will capture any units that could cause errors for having a Continuing result with finish dates in the current calendar year.

Before your organisation can participate in the Victorian Student Number (VSN) system, a number of steps must first be taken:   Firstly, your organisation will be contacted by a member of the VSN implementation team, who will provide you with more information and ask you to sign an authorisation. You cannot be part of the VSN system until this has occurred. You will then receive your login details for the Victorian Student Register (VSR) web services. You will also be allocated your submission day, which will be between the 4th and 18th of each month. Submission Process  NOTE: Only students who have unit-level result activity during the reporting period will be picked up in the VSN search. The submission process for the VSN system is as follows:   When you enter new clients in your system, you need to indicate if they already have a VSN or not. If they have a VSN and know what it is, you must record this number in your system. Each month, you send a list of clients to the VSR. The clients included in the upload are those who have applicable enrolments where there is activity during the reporting period. Activity is determined by looking at the start and finish dates of the units or modules within the enrolment.", "metadata": {"title": "VT-Desktop_51000288848.txt", "link": "https://help-vettrak.readytech.io/support/solutions/articles/51000288848", "category": "VT-Desktop"}}, {"rank": "9", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "Enrolment Wizard  If the location for an enrolment is in Victoria, a tickbox has been added to the AVETMISS page of the Enrolment Wizard to indicate whether to include that enrolment in VSN transfers.

We have a number of units probably around *** that are superseded but equivalent to current units. I need to locate students that have completed the superseded unit that have a current enrolment. At the moment we do this manually by running a report one at a time for each unit. Which as you can imagine is incredibly time consuming. The data insight I am trying to set up is to locate students with a current enrolment that also have had a completed enrolment in a previous year, I figure it will probably be quicker to look per student than per unit.

Based on your requirements, here are the steps you can follow to set up the query:\n\n1. Start a new query and select \"Client Enrolment\" as the Query On option [1].\n2. In the Query Fields, add the fields you want to display such as Client Name, Qualification Name, Enrolment Start/Finish Dates [1].\n3. In the Must Match Criteria section, set up the following filters:\n   a. Add a filter for Enrolment Status = \"Completed\" to get only completed enrolments [2].\n   b. Add a date filter for Enrolment Finish Date to select a range of previous years where the superseded units were completed (e.g. 2018-2020) [1].\n   c. Add a filter for Enrolled Units where the Unit Code is any of the superseded unit codes you have (you can use the \"Is any of\" operator and enter the list of codes) [2].\n   d. Add another filter for Client Enrolment where the Enrolment Status = \"Enrolled\" or \"Confirmed\" to get current/active enrolments [2].\n4. Run the query, and it should now display students who have completed a superseded unit in the specified years and also have an active enrolment [3].\n\nIf you need to update any details for the students retrieved, you can use the bulk actions like \"Update Field\" to make changes to their current enrolments [3].\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with setting up the query.\n\nKind Regards,\n[Your name]"}, {"id": 1, "answer": "Hi there,\n\nThank you for your query regarding using Data Insights to locate students with superseded units. Based on the information provided, it seems possible to set up a Data Insights query to achieve this, although some filtering and criteria setup may be required.\n\nHere are some suggestions on how you could approach this:\n\n1. Start a new Data Insights query on the Client Enrolment table [5]. This will allow you to filter and query based on enrolment details.\n\n2. In the query fields, include details like Client Name, Qualification Name, Enrolment Start/Finish Dates, and any other relevant fields [1].\n\n3. Set up filter criteria to only include enrolments with a finish date in previous years (e.g. before 2023) [1]. This will capture the completed superseded enrolments.\n\n4. Add another filter to only include enrolments with a start date in the current year (e.g. 2023 or later) [1]. This will capture the current enrolments.\n\n5. You may also want to filter for specific qualification codes or superseded unit codes if you only need to check certain qualifications/units [2].\n\n6. Optionally, you could use the \"Query On\" relationship to link the Client Enrolment table to the Enrolled Units table. This would allow you to filter for specific superseded unit codes in the completed enrolments [3].\n\nOnce you have set up the appropriate filters, the query results should show you a list of clients who meet the criteria of having a completed superseded enrolment and a current enrolment. From there, you could potentially use bulk actions or exports to further process or review the data [2][3].\n\nIf you continue to have issues with the query setup, I'd recommend reviewing the Data Insights documentation or seeking assistance from our support team.

These changes will likely impact existing third-party applications that are using the API to integrate with VETtrak. The changes do not affect most VETtrak-produced integrations such as VETsurvey, VETnet, Trainer Portal, Student Portal, VTDocs and Progress Portal, but VETenrol is affected by the changes. For VETtrak administrators  After upgrading to VETtrak 18.1, to continue to use the API, you must have a new \"VETtrak API\" feature in your VETtrak registration key. To update your registration key, in VETtrak, go to the File menu -> Global Preferences -> Registration key -> Update Key Automatically button. If this is not done, the following error will occur when calling nearly every API function: The registration key does not contain a valid registration for the \"VETtrak API\" feature. In VETtrak, go to the File menu -> Global Preferences -> Registration Key to view the registration information, and press \"Update key automatically\" to update it. Contact VETtrak Support if you need to obtain a valid registration for this feature. In the Security Manager in VETtrak, a new \"API VETtrak\" application will then be available.

Each one can optionally have a default expiry months if they need to be renewed regularly. For each position, define what capabilities are required to perform that job and should be held by clients in that position. The default expiry months for each position capability can be overridden. When recording unit results, task activity, skills, awards in qualifications, or credentials, for items that contribute to capability profiles, VETtrak will add the affected items to the capability profile of the related client(s).", "metadata": {"title": "VT-Desktop_51000288078.txt", "link": "https://help-vettrak.readytech.io/support/solutions/articles/51000288078", "category": "VT-Desktop"}}, {"rank": "10", "source": "freshdesk", "content": "The terminology of \"built-in\" reports has been replaced by \"right click\" reports to better describe what they are.

I understand your concern about removing units from an occurrence without affecting other results.\n\nTo remove units from an occurrence, you can follow these steps:\n1. Right-click on the Units/Modules heading in the occurrence and select \"Add Unit to Occurrence\" [1].\n2. In the wizard, you can remove the units you don't need by deselecting them from the list [1].\n\nHowever, removing units from an occurrence will not affect existing results for other units in the same occurrence [1]. The results for the remaining units will stay intact.\n\nIf you need to associate or dissociate units with specific classes within the occurrence, you can use the \"Link Occurrence Units and Classes\" wizard [2]. This allows you to link or unlink units to classes without impacting results.\n\nAdditionally, you can drag and drop units onto classes to distribute them across multiple classes [2]. This is a simple way to manage unit-class associations without affecting results.\n\nPlease note that if you need to remove all activity recorded against a task before removing it from the occurrence [3]. If there is activity recorded, you will need to clear all fields in the Task Activity Wizard first.\n\nLet me know if you need any further assistance with managing units and results within occurrences.\n\nKind regards,"}, {"id": 1, "answer": "Hi there,\n\nThank you for the feedback on the article \"Process: Removing/Resetting a Unit/Module Result\".

This will open the Add Unit Wizard where you can remove units from the occurrence [1]. Removing units from an occurrence through this wizard will not affect any existing results for other units in the occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, you can drag and drop units from the Units/Modules heading onto the relevant classes to remove them from those classes [2].

I can understand the confusion caused by the title not matching the content accurately.\n\nThe article covers how to reset or remove results for a single unit within an occurrence, but it does not provide guidance on removing an entire unit from the occurrence itself while preserving results for other units.\n\nBased on your feedback, it seems there is a gap in our documentation regarding how to remove units from an occurrence without impacting other unit results. I will log this as an improvement for our documentation team to address. [1][2][4][5]\n\nIn the meantime, if you need to remove units from an occurrence, I would suggest first removing any result data for those units using the reset process covered in the article. Then, you should be able to remove the units themselves from the occurrence without affecting other unit results.

Our courses are currently set up as per below. Basically clients need to complete a form and make a payment for us to commence the process for them. We would like to record the client info in VETtrak and would like advise on how to set this up. Do we simply set up a programme as we do for courses? We don\u2019t need to have an occurrence and a class and don\u2019t want to display a date range as it is not relevant. Or do we create a form and link it to VETrak? Is this something that can be done in *********? I had a brief chat about this with ****** yesterday afternoon after he assisted with another issue and thought best to send an email so that we can record a ticket.\n\n[cid:image**\n\n.png@*\n\nD**\n\nC\n\n. **\n\nFD**\n\n]\n\nKind Regards,\n\n*********\n\nTraining Administrator\n\n[signature_*********\n\n]\n\nAddress: *************************************", "metadata": {"title": "VT-Desktop_43137.txt", "link": "https://help-education.readytech.io/a/tickets/43137", "category": "VT-Desktop"}}, {"rank": "102", "source": "ticket", "content": "Ticket Subject: Custom Step\n\nField Type\n\nHi VETtrak Support, I ve created a Custom Step below for a selected programme with the following questions.
